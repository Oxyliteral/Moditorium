This Doukutsu.exe is an edited version of the actual Doukutsu.exe, mainly changing the memory addresses to edit some NPC values.
For some reason, the Cave Story mod doesn't work without it, no matter how much compatibility I try to achieve.
It seems to be a bit finicky, so playing the mod is possible, but some maps will crash the game upon being loaded.
Hence, I have left it here just in case anyone wants to actually play the mod.
